GPU enabled TensorFlow builds on conda-forge
============================================

Recently we've been able to add GPU-enabled TensorFlow builds to conda-forge! This was quite a journey, with multiple contributors trying different ways to convince the Bazel-based build system of TensorFlow to build CUDA-enabled packages. But we managed, `and the pull request got merged <https://github.com/conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock/pull/157>`_.

We now have a configuration in place that creates CUDA-enabled TensorFlow builds for all conda-forge supported configurations (CUDA 10.2, 11.0, 11.1, and 11.2+). Building out the CUDA packages requires beefy machines â€“ on a 32 core machine it still takes around 3 hours to build a single package. Our build matrix now includes 12 CUDA-enabled packages & 3 CPU packages (because we need separate packages per Python version). As one can imagine, this isn't easily possible on an average "home computer".

For this purpose, we have written an Ansible playbook that lets us boot up cloud machines which then build the feedstock (using the `build-locally.py` script). Thanks to the generous support of OVH we were able to boot multiple 32-core virtual machines simultaneously to build the different TensorFlow variants.

We have open-sourced the `Ansible playbook in GitHub <https://github.com/mamba-org/build-locally-ansible>`_ and we're working towards making it (more) generally useful for other long-running builds!

With the TensorFlow builds in place, conda-forge now has CUDA-enabled builds for PyTorch and Tensorflow, the two most popular deep learning libraries. 

We are still missing Windows builds for TensorFlow (CPU & CUDA, unfortunately) and would love the community to help us out with that. There is an open PR, but it probably needs some poking in Bazel to get it to pass: https://github.com/conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock/pull/111.

We hope that these new GPU builds will enable many more packages to be added to the conda-forge channel! We are already looking forward to the 2.6.2 and 2.7 releases of TensorFlow and to adding Windows support in the future. We hope you enjoy this work.

Installation
------------

You can now select between GPU enabled (default) and CPU packages using the `tensorflow-gpu` and `tensorflow-cpu` packages. Just run

.. code-block:: bash

    mamba install tensorflow-gpu -c conda-forge
    # OR
    conda install tensorflow-gpu -c conda-forge

When installing the `tensorflow` package, the package resolution will now default to the `tensorflow-gpu` package if the local machine has a GPU. Note that GPU-enabled packages can also work on CPUs, but one would need to override the enviornment variable `CONDA_CUDA_OVERRIDE` like below. This could be handy if you are in a situation where your current node (e.g. login node) on an HPC does not have GPUs, but the compute nodes with GPUs do not have internet access.

.. code-block:: bash

    CONDA_CUDA_OVERRIDE="11.2" conda install tensorflow -c conda-forge
    # OR
    CONDA_CUDA_OVERRIDE="11.2" mamba install tensorflow -c conda-forge

Note that you should select the cudatoolkit version most appropraite for your GPU; currently, we have "10.2", "11.0", "11.1", and "11.2" available. If you want the slimmer "cpu-only" package, then you can install `tensorflow-cpu` directly. At the time of writing (February 2022), on a machine without a GPU, one would always get the `-cpu` variant unless overriden like above. This decision has been made to allow greater accessibility for users with limited bandwidth and resources.
